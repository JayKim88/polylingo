# Testing Guide

## Fast Development Workflow

For daily development, use these optimized test commands:

```bash
# Fast unit tests (4-5 seconds) - Use this for development
npm run test:fast

# All unit tests excluding integrations (~8 seconds)
npm run test:unit  

# Full test suite including slow integration tests (~30 seconds)
npm test

# Watch mode for active development
npm run test:watch -- --testPathIgnorePatterns='integration|iapService'
```

## Test Categories

### ‚ö° **Fast Tests** (~4.5s)
- Component tests
- Utility functions  
- Storage service
- Translation API (unit tests)

### üêå **Slow Tests** (~25s)
- IAP Service integration (real Apple Store calls)
- Speech Service (native module timeouts)
- Complex integration tests

## Performance Tips

1. **Use `npm run test:fast` during development** - Runs in 4.5 seconds vs 31 seconds
2. **Only run full test suite before commits** - Use `npm test` for complete validation
3. **Integration tests are meant for CI/CD** - They test real external services

## Current Test Status

- **Total Tests:** 241
- **Fast Tests:** 141  
- **Pass Rate:** 83.8% (202 passing, 39 failing)
- **TypeScript:** 100% compilation success ‚úÖ

The 39 failing tests are primarily integration tests that require real external services or complex native module setup.
